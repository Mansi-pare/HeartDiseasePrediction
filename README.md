❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

A machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient health indicators.

📌 Project Overview

This project uses a medical dataset containing various health and lifestyle features to predict the risk of heart disease.

The workflow includes:

Loading & cleaning the dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Splitting data into train/test sets

Training ML models

Comparing model performance

📈 Results & Insights

The model successfully identifies key patterns in medical indicators that correlate with heart disease risk.

Important predictors include cholesterol levels, BMI, blood pressure, age, and lifestyle habits.

Machine learning models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

These insights can help support early detection and health risk assessments.
